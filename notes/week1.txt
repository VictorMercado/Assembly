A program is a collection of source files. 
We will be using:
-ASM : x86 = 1980 was first 16 bit
            -in 2005 64 bit processor was made

-Bash
-C++
-C

Compiling 

Hybrid Program:
    -driver is cpp main function
    -the asm file contains a function that will call these cpp functions:
        - scanf
        - printf
        -atof
    the asm file will also call another asm function from a different file:
        -isfloat
